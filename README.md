# React Native Project Readme

This readme file provides essential information about the React Native project. It serves as a guide for developers and contributors to understand the project structure, installation steps, dependencies, and other relevant details.

## Project Overview

The React Native project aims to build a cross-platform mobile application using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create native mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase. The project follows best practices and utilizes various libraries, tools, and frameworks to enhance the development process.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version >= 12.x.x)
- npm (version >= 6.x.x)
- React Native CLI (globally installed)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from the remote repository.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the React Native application on a simulator or device, use the following commands:

### iOS

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

This command will launch the iOS simulator and install the application.

### Android

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

This command will build the Android application and launch it on an Android emulator or connected device.

**Note:** Ensure that you have a simulator/emulator set up or a physical device connected before running the above commands.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a common convention used in React Native projects. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

- `android/`: Contains the Android-specific project files and configuration.
- `ios/`: Contains the iOS-specific project files and configuration.
- `src/`: Contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components.
  - `screens/`: Contains the main screens of the application.
  - `navigation/`: Contains the navigation configuration and routing logic.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility functions and helper files.
  - `App.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and defines scripts for running the application and other tasks.
